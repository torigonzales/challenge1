## Description 
Challenge #1- Debugging code! 
The first challenge in a series of challenges throuout the Boot Camp. 

---


## Introduction 
In this challenge we debugged the "Horiseon" web page. There was a lot of organization that needed to happen! There were challenges, but overall this was a very eye-opening and fun challenge to kick off the Boot Camp! 


---

## Challenges 
I found that there was a lot of organization that needed to happen within the starter HTML and CSS code. There was a lot of unnecessary and repeat syntax. Here a good example what it should look like:
<img src="./images/screenshot1.png" /> 
<img src="./images/screenshot2.png" />

---

## Victories 
I finally have a better understanding of GitHub! I was able to "Push" my work, and commit it as well!
